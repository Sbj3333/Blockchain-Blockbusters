            <p class="about1">Our Web application provides smooth and user-friendly interface to trade real-world
                stocks. We
                make transactions possible in both digital and crypto-currency with blockchain technology. This ensures
                quicker and more secure, transparent transactions. We use smart contracts in Ethereum Blockchain using
                “Solidity” which are more efficient and trust-worthy. We guide the new user on how to start their
                journey in
                this whole new world with a kickstart of 5 coins in their wallet. To make the learning more interactive
                we
                also have an auto chatbot built up using “Dialogflow”. Tokenizing of real world stocks into digital
                tokens
                on a blockchain helps in the complete usage of Blockchain technology. Peer-to-Peer transactions are
                hassle
                free with DIRECT one-to-one trading using wallets which cuts off several layers of intermediaries
                including
                stock exchangers, brokers and transfer agents. Additional features we would like to add in the
